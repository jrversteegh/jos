These arduino libraries include a set of task based components that do 
non-blocking IO (no calls to "delay" or "while" loops) A central tasklist
runs all tasks in a loop. Each task indicates whether it is runnable and 
determines what it should do when running by means of a task state.

Currently the following components are available:
* Hardware serial (no block on write -> tx buffer)
* 4 bit LCD display (no blocking wait between commands -> one 
  command at a time)
* Wiznet ethershield (working on enc28j60) 

Since each task quickly returns to the mainloop without blocking, the 
arduino remains responsive and won't miss e.g. IO pin signals.
